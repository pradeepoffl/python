    "\n",
    "In Python, the terms \"module,\" \"package,\" and \"library\" have distinct meanings, though they are often used interchangeably in casual conversation. Here's a breakdown of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "Module:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A module is a single file (with a .py extension) that contains Python code. This can include functions, classes, and variables.\n",
    "- You can create your own modules or use built-in ones (like math or os).\n",
    "- To use a module, you typically import it using the import statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Package:\n",
    "- A package is a collection of related modules organized in a directory hierarchy. It includes an __init__.py file that can be empty or execute initialization code for the package.\n",
    "- Packages allow for a logical organization of modules, often used to group related functionality (e.g., numpy is a package that contains many modules for numerical computing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Library:\n",
    "- A library is a broader term that refers to a collection of modules and packages that provide specific functionality. It can include both built-in and third-party modules.\n",
    "- Libraries are often used to solve specific problems or add specific capabilities to your Python programs (e.g., Pandas for data manipulation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "- Modules: Single files with Python code.\n",
    "- Packages: Directories containing multiple modules and an `__init__.py` file.\n",
    "- Libraries: Collections of modules and packages that provide reusable functionality.\n",
    "So while all of these can involve code reuse, they represent different levels of organization and structure in Python programming."
